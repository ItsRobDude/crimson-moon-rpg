Traits
Spectral Nature. Caitríona is an incorporeal spirit bound to the Cathedral of Bone. She doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep. She hovers gently off the ground and can pass through small gaps or around obstacles if needed. If reduced to 0 HP, she discorporates into a swirl of silvery light, re-forming at the Cathedral after 24 hours unless the Cathedral’s magic is dispelled.
Serene Presence. Hostile creatures within 10 feet of Caitríona feel an odd sense of calm tug at their minds. When a hostile creature makes its first attack on a turn while in that area, it must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it can’t target Caitríona with that attack and must choose a different target (or lose the attack if no valid target exists). A creature that succeeds is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
Spellcasting (Cleric). Caitríona is a 6th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following cleric spells prepared/known (focusing on healing, restoration, and pacification):
Cantrips (at will):Guidance, Sacred Flame, Spare the Dying, Thaumaturgy
1st Level (4 slots):Cure Wounds, Sanctuary, Detect Magic, Command
2nd Level (3 slots):Calm Emotions, Lesser Restoration, Spiritual Weapon
3rd Level (2 slots):Revivify, Mass Healing Word
Gentle Heart (Healer’s Mercy). When Caitríona reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a spell or melee attack, she can choose not to kill it; instead, the creature becomes stable and unconscious at 0 HP. This underscores her unwillingness to fully destroy life, even in undeath.

Actions
Multiattack. Caitríona makes two Sacred Flame attacks (cantrips) or casts one leveled spell and uses a cantrip in the same round (adhering to 5e’s bonus action/spellcasting rules as appropriate).
Spectral Touch (Melee Spell Attack):+6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) radiant damage. A creature that takes this damage must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on its next attack roll against Caitríona, as her soothing aura briefly confuses aggression.
Tranquil Respite (Recharge 5–6).Caitríona channels healing energies in a 20-foot radius. Each creature of her choice in that area regains 7 (2d6) hit points. Hostile creatures that regain hit points from this effect must immediately make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become Charmed by Caitríona until the end of their next turn, overwhelmed by her gentle aura.

Behavior & Tactics
Nonviolent First Approach: Caitríona rarely initiates combat unless threatened. She might start with Sanctuary or Calm Emotions to de-escalate a tense encounter.
Healing Allies (or Herself): If forced to fight alongside other Cathedral guardians (e.g., Fiona, Aisling), she’ll cast Mass Healing Word or Cure Wounds to sustain them, then move to the fringes, letting her Serene Presence hamper attackers.
Avoiding Lethality: In line with her Gentle Heart trait, she tries not to kill unless absolutely necessary. She’ll stabilize downed foes if it suits her or the Cathedral’s “need for living worshipers or watchers.”
Spell Priority:
Round 1: Sanctuary or Calm Emotions if hostilities begin.
Round 2: Possibly Spiritual Weapon for defense, or Command to pacify a strong melee fighter.
Round 3+: Tranquil Respite if her allies are injured or to disrupt the party’s aggression. If cornered, she might Revivify an ally or Mass Healing Word to keep undead guardians up.

Roleplay & Personality Hooks
Quiet Acceptance: She has come to terms with Whisperwood’s fate, believing nature sometimes takes a dark course beyond mortal control. She tries to minimize suffering.
Fond of Aodhan: She admired his drive to save Liam and the borough, insisting he wouldn’t truly unleash evil. She doesn’t blame him wholly—she suspects outside manipulation (possibly from Alderic).
Offers Compassion: If the party isn’t overtly hostile, Caitríona can provide healing or advice, explaining that the stasis-bound Liam still “lives” in some form—and that there may be a way to free him.

Treasure / Loot
Symbol of the Healing Ward: A small silver amulet shaped like intertwined vines, worth 25 gp but can also serve as a holy symbol for a cleric/druid/paladin.
Medical Satchel (Spectral): Contains intangible vials or herbs. If the party can “dispel” or “coalesce” them, it might yield 1–2 Potion of Healing or Greater Healing potions (GM’s choice).
Cathedral Records: Possibly stashed in her old healing ward, containing notes on who was injured or sick prior to the ritual. Some references might tie into Liam’s condition or Aodhan’s frantic attempts to gather power.
