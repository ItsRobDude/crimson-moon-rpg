Traits
Ethereal Presence. Breithiún Meáchan exists partially in the Ethereal Plane. He can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. He takes 5 (1d10) force damage if he ends his turn inside an object.
Bargainer's Appeal. When a creature within 30 feet of Breithiún Meáchan makes an attack roll against him, it must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Spellcasting. Breithiún Meáchan is a 10th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). He requires no material components to cast his spells.
    At will: detect thoughts, minor illusion, guidance
    3/day each: calm emotions, suggestion, zone of truth
    1/day each: mass suggestion, banishment, dimension door
Actions
Multiattack. Breithiún Meáchan makes two Radiant Touch attacks.

Radiant Touch. Melee Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) radiant damage.

Weigh the Scales (Recharge 5–6). Breithiún Meáchan forces all creatures of his choice within 20 feet to confront their inner desires. Each target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is incapacitated until the end of its next turn as it becomes overwhelmed with bargaining thoughts. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected.

Reactions
Counter Offer. When a creature within 30 feet targets Breithiún Meáchan with an attack or harmful spell, he can offer a telepathic bargain. The creature must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose to either redirect the attack to another creature of Breithiún's choice within range or take 15 (2d10 + 4) psychic damage.

Description
Breithiún Meáchan appears as a luminous, ethereal figure cloaked in shifting light and shadow. His eyes glow with a soft, persuasive light that seems to peer into one's soul. Representing the bargaining stage of grief, he embodies the desperate hope and negotiation people experience in the face of loss.

Tactics
    Negotiator First: Breithiún prefers to engage the party in dialogue, attempting to dissuade them from their path by offering alternatives or appealing to their desires.
    Control Over Damage: He uses spells like calm emotions and suggestion to manipulate the battlefield without causing direct harm.
    Defensive Combatant: If forced into combat, he relies on Bargainer's Appeal and Counter Offer to minimize incoming damage.
    Weigh the Scales: He uses this ability to incapacitate multiple opponents, especially if surrounded.
