Radiant Volley
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack from this bow, it takes an extra 1d4 radiant damage. A burst of gentle white light flares on impact.
Blessed Arrow (1/Day)
Before you make a ranged weapon attack, you can declare it a Blessed Arrow. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be Blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes an extra 2d4 radiant damage but isn’t Blinded.
Appearance & Lore:
Free of fungal decay, the bow seems carved from moonlight-touched wood. Legend says it shines brightest against undead or fiendish foes, a testament to the power of light over corruption.
