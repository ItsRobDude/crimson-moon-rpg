Aisling’s Corrupt Vigil

    Weapon (Longbow), Uncommon (requires attunement)
    Damage: 1d8 + Dexterity modifier (piercing)
    Properties: Ammunition (range 150/600), Heavy, Two-Handed

Twisted fungus grows across this longbow’s limbs, and faintly glowing spores pulse in the wood’s crevices. Its string emits a soft hiss when drawn, hinting at the toxic power within. The bow trembles in your hand, almost yearning for redemption and something more…

The bow bears the Mark of Ciara, Her Majesty watches closely…

Magic Weapon (+1)

    You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this longbow.

Lingering Spores
    Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack from this bow, it takes an extra 1d4 poison damage.

Toxic Shot (1/Day)
    Before you make a ranged weapon attack, you can declare it a Toxic Shot. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become Poisoned until the end of its next turn.
    On a success, the target isn’t Poisoned, but it still suffers any normal attack damage (including the bow’s extra poison).
