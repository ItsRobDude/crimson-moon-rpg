Eoin’s Lantern Heart
(Necklace, Uncommon, Requires Attunement)
Appearance
The necklace still bears the worn, simple pendant Eoin’s mother gave him. However, after his spirit blesses it, a faint glow—like a gently flickering candle—can sometimes be seen pulsing at its center, especially when the bearer feels anxious or in need of direction.
Power & Effects
Never Truly Lost
While wearing Eoin’s Lantern Heart, you gain advantage on Survival checks made to navigate or avoid becoming lost, even in unnatural or confusing terrains.
Eoin’s lingering wish for home guides your steps. You sense subtle tugs in the right direction, almost like a child’s hand leading you.
Kindred Light (1/Day)
As a bonus action, you can tap into the necklace’s glow to emit a soft aura in a 10-foot radius.
Allies within this light gain +1 to all saving throws against being Frightened or Charmed until the end of your next turn.
Hidden Lore (optional flavor tie-in)
The moment Eoin’s Lantern Heart was blessed, a faint echo of Eoin’s motherly love seeped into it. On a successful DC 14 Arcana or Religion check, a wearer might glimpse fleeting visions of Eoin’s memories—cozy nights under the footbridge, or his mother’s lullaby. It offers no mechanical boon beyond narrative insight, but enriches roleplay.
