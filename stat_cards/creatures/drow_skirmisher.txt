Skills:
Stealth +5, Perception +3, Acrobatics +5
Senses:
Superior Darkvision 120 ft.
Traits:
Sunlight Sensitivity: Disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight when in direct sunlight.
Fey Ancestry (Drow): Advantage on saving throws against being charmed; magic can’t put the Drow to sleep.
Actions:
Multiattack: The Skirmisher makes two melee or two ranged attacks.
Shortsword (Melee): +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 1d6 + 3 piercing. Target must succeed on a DC 13 Con save or be Poisoned for 1 hour; if the save fails by 5 or more, the target is also Unconscious (as per Drow poison).
Hand Crossbow (Ranged): +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target.
Hit: 1d6 + 3 piercing + same poison effect as above.
Bonus Action (Optional): “Mobile Strike”
Once per round, if the Skirmisher hits with a melee attack, it can Dash or Disengage as a bonus action.
(This adds some agility without spiking CR too high.)
Tactics:
Use Stealth and ambush tactics.
Focus fire on isolated or spellcasting party members.
Retreat or regroup if more than half the Drow are slain or if the tide clearly turns against them.
