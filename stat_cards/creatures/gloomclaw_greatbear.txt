Traits
Spore Infestation.Any creature that takes damage from the Mycelic Greatbear’s melee attacks must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become Poisoned until the end of its next turn. While Poisoned in this way, the creature also has disadvantage on Strength checks and saving throws as fungal growth stiffens its muscles.
Moldbound Regeneration (1/Day).When the Mycelic Greatbear is reduced to 0 hit points for the first time, it releases a cloud of spores, regaining 10 hit points. After using this trait, the Greatbear can’t use it again until it finishes a long rest.
Fetid Stench.Creatures starting their turn within 5 feet of the Mycelic Greatbear must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or have their speed halved until the start of their next turn (from coughing and choking on fungal fumes).

Actions
Multiattack.The Mycelic Greatbear makes two attacks: one with its Bite and one with its Claws.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage. On a hit, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer the Spore Infestation effect (see above).
Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.Hit: 12 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a hit, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer the Spore Infestation effect (see above).
Spore Spray (Recharge 5–6).The Mycelic Greatbear exhales a 15-foot cone of toxic spores. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (3d6) poison damage and is Poisoned for 1 minute. The Poisoned creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a success, a creature takes half damage and isn’t Poisoned.
