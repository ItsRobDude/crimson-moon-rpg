Corpse-Fed Growth. Whenever the Gallows-Stag starts its turn within 5 feet of a corpse (Small or larger), it regains 5 hit points. It must have at least half its maximum hit points remaining for this trait to function (if reduced below half, it can no longer draw nourishment effectively).

Stench of Decay. A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the Gallows-Stag must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become Poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Gallows-Stag’s Stench of Decay for the next 24 hours.

Actions
Multiattack. The Gallows-Stag makes two attacks: one with its Gore and one with its Hooves.


Gore. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage. If the Gallows-Stag moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the attack, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Hooves. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 10 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

Spore Burst (Recharge 6). The Gallows-Stag releases a violent eruption of spores in a 10-foot radius around itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is Blinded until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the poison damage and isn’t Blinded.

Deathly Vigil. When the Gallows-Stag is reduced to 0 hit points, it utters a haunting bray. Each allied spore-infected beast or undead creature within 30 feet of it gains advantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
