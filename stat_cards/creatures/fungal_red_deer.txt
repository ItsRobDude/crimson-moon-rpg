Fungal Red Deer
Large Undead (Beast), Typically Neutral Evil

A corrupted version of the graceful red deer, now towering with spore-infested antlers. Fungus-laced eyes glow with otherworldly malice. Their ragged hides are partially peeled away, revealing fibrous strands of fungus and decaying muscle.

Trampling Hooves. If the deer moves at least 20 feet straight toward a prone creature and hits it with a Hooves attack on the same turn, that target takes an extra 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked unconscious for 1 minute. The creature can repeat its save at the end of each of its turns.

Spore Antlers. Creatures grappled or shoved by the antlers must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) poison damage at the start of their next turn.
