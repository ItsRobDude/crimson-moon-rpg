2. Dynamic World Events & Roaming NPCs
=========================================
These events occur independently of the player's actions as time passes.

The Spreading Sporefall:
------------------------
The barrier Aodhan created around Whisperwood is actively weakening. The Sporefall (plague and Underdark environment) is spreading into the Shadowmire Forest. The barrier will eventually fail completely (it fails during the events at Hushbriar Cove), causing the Crimson Moon and darkness to spread globally.

Alderic's Lockdown:
-------------------
As the plague spreads, Alderic quarantines Silverthorn. He occupies Hushbriar Cove under the guise of protection while searching for Aodhan and the Demigod Elara. He begins "processing" refugees (sending the strong to Silverthorn, the weak to the "Soul Mill").
